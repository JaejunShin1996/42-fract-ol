# Fract'ol - Computer Graphics Fractals

## Project Overview

**Fract'ol** is a computer graphics project focused on generating and exploring beautiful fractals. Using the MiniLibX graphical library, the project renders well-known fractals such as the Julia set and the Mandelbrot set, with interactive zoom and various graphical features. The project introduces concepts in complex numbers, fractal geometry, and event-driven graphical programming, providing hands-on experience with computer graphics.

The program allows users to visually explore fractals by zooming in and out and modifying parameters, offering a visually dynamic way to interact with these complex mathematical structures.

## Technical Details

- **Rendering**:
  - The program uses the **MiniLibX** library to open a window, handle mouse and keyboard events, and render images.
  - Fractals are displayed in real-time, with smooth interaction, such as minimizing, switching between windows, and quitting the program cleanly.

- **Fractal Generation**:
  - The **Julia set** is customizable by passing parameters via the command line.
  - The **Mandelbrot set** is rendered by default or when specified via a parameter.

- **User Interaction**:
  - **Zoom**: The user can zoom in and out using the mouse wheel, exploring the fractal at deeper levels.
  - **Window Management**: The program supports closing the window using the ESC key or by clicking the windowâ€™s close button, ensuring a clean exit.

## Bonus Features

In addition to the core functionality, the following bonus features were implemented:

- **Additional Fractals**: Added support for an extra type of fractal (beyond the Julia and Mandelbrot sets).
- **Advanced Zoom**: The zoom follows the mouse position for a more interactive exploration experience.
- **View Navigation**: The view can be moved using the arrow keys, adding further control to explore different parts of the fractal.
- **Color Shifting**: The color range dynamically shifts, providing a visually appealing effect as the fractal is explored.
